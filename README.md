# Visualizer_sort

Overview

This project is a web-based Sorting Visualizer that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It provides an interactive interface where users can select a sorting algorithm, adjust the sorting speed, and watch the sorting process in real-time.
Features

    Multiple Sorting Algorithms:
        Bubble Sort
        Selection Sort
        Insertion Sort
        Quick Sort
        Merge Sort
    Speed Control: Adjust the speed of the visualization using a slider.
    Random Array Generation: Generate a new random array to sort at any time.
    Interactive Visualization: Visualize the sorting process with color-coded bars representing the array elements.

Project Structure

    index.html: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
    style.css: The CSS file that styles the Sorting Visualizer interface.
    script.js: The JavaScript file that contains the sorting algorithms, visualization logic, and event handlers.

Files

    index.html:
        Defines the layout of the Sorting Visualizer, including the canvas for the bar chart and the control elements (buttons, slider, dropdown menu).
        Includes external libraries like jQuery and Chart.js for dynamic content and chart visualization.

    style.css:
        Provides styling for the visualizer interface, including layout, colors, and responsive design.

    script.js:
        Implements the sorting algorithms and the logic for animating the sorting process.
        Handles user interactions, such as changing the sorting speed, selecting a sorting algorithm, and generating a new random array.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

To run this project, you need a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.
Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

    git clone <repository-url>
    cd SortingVisualizer

    Open the index.html file:
        Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

    Start Visualizing:
        Use the dropdown menu to select a sorting algorithm.
        Adjust the speed of the sorting process using the slider.
        Click "Sort" to start the visualization or "Random" to generate a new array.

How to Use

    Select a Sorting Algorithm: Choose an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
    Adjust Speed: Use the slider to change the speed of the sorting visualization.
    Generate Random Array: Click the "Random" button to create a new array of random values.
    Start Sorting: Click the "Sort" button to visualize the selected sorting algorithm.

Customization

    Add New Algorithms: You can add more sorting algorithms by implementing them in the script.js file and updating the dropdown menu in index.html.
    Modify Styling: Customize the appearance by editing the style.css file.

External Libraries

    jQuery: Used for DOM manipulation and event handling.
    Chart.js: Used for 
    
rendering the bar chart that visualizes the sorting process.
